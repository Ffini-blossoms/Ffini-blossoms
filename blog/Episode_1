## ðŸŽ­ Episode 1: Ffini & Fizzbit Explore SOC Fundamentals

> _A whimsical conversation between me and my mythical sidekick, Fizzbit the Cyber Cat._

**Ffini:** Fizzbit, todayâ€™s adventure took us through the world of SOC!
**Fizzbit:** I told you, sorting through those piles of socks would be a world of their own.
**Ffini:** Not socks my fierce feline ...the world of Security Operations Center. 
**Fizzbit:** Meow-bad! Did you enjoy the journey?  
**Ffini:** Absolutely! The Let's Defend Learning Pathway was so well-structured and user-friendly. The UI made navigating and understanding foundational conceptsâ€”like Log Management, Case Management, and Endpoint Securityâ€”a breeze.  
**Fizzbit:** Ooh, those sound important! Did you get to try anything hands-on?  
**Ffini:** You bet. The SOC Fundamentals section had an interactive playbook full of videos and activities. I even got to perform multiple searches to find malware based on different types: IP, URL, Hash, and Domain.  
**Fizzbit:** Pawsome! Did you face any tricky challenges?  
**Ffini:** There were a few basic SOC alerts to complete, plus a quiz to test what Iâ€™d learned. But the real challenge was diving into the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.  
**Fizzbit:** MITRE ATT&CK? That sounds fancyâ€”whatâ€™s that all about?  
**Ffini:** It stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge. Itâ€™s a knowledge database introduced back in 2013, and itâ€™s constantly updated alongside new tech. The coolest part? It serves as a clear roadmap for systematically analyzing cyber attacks, step by step!  
**Fizzbit:** So itâ€™s like a treasure map for cyber defenders?  
**Ffini:** Exactly! And speaking of maps, we also explored the Cyber Kill Chain framework, which breaks down an attack into seven stages:  
- Reconnaissance  
- Weaponization  
- Delivery  
- Exploitation  
- Installation  
- Command and control (C2)  
- Actions on Objectives

**Fizzbit:** So many steps! Did you get lost?  
**Ffini:** Not at all. With these frameworks, itâ€™s way easier to visualize how attackers moveâ€”and how defenders can stop them.  
**Fizzbit:** Sounds like youâ€™re one step closer to being a SOC superstar! Whatâ€™s next?  
**Ffini:** Next up: diving deeper into security tools used and exploring the rabbit hole of SIEM. We'll also learn about understanding real-world incident response scenarios and sharpening my threat detection skills. Stay tuned!
